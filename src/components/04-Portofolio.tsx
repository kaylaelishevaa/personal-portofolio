              Situation
            </h3>
            <p className="text-dark-black text-md md:text-lg">
              As a highly motivated student at Monash University pursuing dual
              degrees in Computer Science and Commerce, along with a Masterâ€™s in
              Software Engineering, I wanted to showcase my ability to develop
              modern web applications. At only 16 years old, I aim to graduate
              at 20, already equipped with advanced skills in programming,
              machine learning, and optimization. My objective was to create a
              portfolio project demonstrating real-world solutions for client
              needs, including responsive design, scalable back-end
              architecture, and seamless user experiences.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-dark-black text-md md:text-lg">
              I set out to develop a web platform combining advanced front-end
              and back-end technologies. The platform needed to include features
              such as interactive UI, efficient algorithms, secure data
              handling, and optimized performance. My role was to manage the
              entire development process while ensuring accessibility for users
              speaking English, Indonesian, and Chinese.
